The efficiency of air travel is a vital aspect of contemporary transportation networks, affecting millions of travelers, enterprises, and the national economy. The primary goal is to create an interactive dashboard for analyzing extensive domestic flight data, including major airlines' on-time performance, delays, cancellations, and diversions. It seeks to uncover hidden patterns and trends, enabling users to identify recurring issues, understand cancellation reasons, and recognize overall performance trends. This dashboard will evaluate the overall effectiveness of U.S. air travel by assessing punctuality, disruption frequency, and airline reliability, benefiting stakeholders such as airlines, travelers, and policymakers.

Amidst the backdrop of 926.8 million passengers traveling via domestic airlines in the United States, the aviation industry grappled with a substantial number of flight disruptions. A staggering 13.4 million flights experienced delays throughout the year, equating to an average of about 36,712 flights per day. These delays, whether due to weather, technical issues, or other factors, undoubtedly impacted travelers and airlines alike. 

Additionally, there were approximately 263,000 canceled flights by U.S. carriers in 2019, translating to an average of about 720 flights canceled each day. These figures underscore the complexity and challenges faced by the air travel system, highlighting the importance of projects like ours that aim to analyze and understand the underlying patterns and causes of such disruptions. Through our project on air traffic analytics, we aim to shed light on these issues, ultimately seeking to improve the efficiency and reliability of domestic flights.
